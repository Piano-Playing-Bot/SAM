The library was downloaded from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/

The following changes were made to the library's copy:

- All files and folders, except for the LICENSE, src/ and .gitignore were removed
- Several functions, types, etc. were renamed to start with the prefix "RL_". This was done to prevent name collisions
